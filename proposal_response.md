Your introduction describes your research intentions and aim very clearly with brevity and does a good job introducing your investigation and the hypothesis, well done. 

However, you do not explain the context to your research or why you are conducting it, the goal is clear, but the justification is lacking, this results in an introduction that reads like an introduction to the methodology rather than the proposal of the work. 

On the contrary, such an approach makes the intentions very clear and the work very nice to follow keeping the reader engaged, continue this style for the final report.

The use of bullet point impacts is nice and the preservations regarding the Wikipedia metric are interesting and presented in a manner that engages the reader.

The identified literature is well selected, covering the topics you are investigating in your research, all from good sources.
Your background and related work explain the concepts of your research well defining them nicely.

However, your definition-based background does not provide much insight into the rationale behind your research question/hypothesis.
You identify reasons for your proposed metric concept such as no application for the developed algorithms by VVG but do not provide an argument as to why you would not employ previous metrics over yours.

You identify background to support your work but not alternatives to justify why your work is needed.

Your hypothesis proposed is well motivated at identifying the differences between the two methods and propose your new metric as a measure of comparison in a clear direction.

I do however feel that this is disconnected from your introduction, you emphasize your new metric but only use this to determine performance of semantic relationships between two known methods.

In the report, focus on this metric and the analysis of this metric, as this is a unique strong point of your work, and use the methods as a test bench.
Also, if you are focusing on the metric, you could propose that you are going to investigate 'if your metric is a better measure of similarity than other approaches'.

Overall, the work is presented well, and the intentions are clear with an interesting observation justified by the lack of use of Wikipedia metrics in application.

Make sure you refine your structure for the final report as the short paragraphs in the research question section are a distraction to the content. Well done!
